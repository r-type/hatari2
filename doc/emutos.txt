Hatari and EmuTOS
=================

To run the emulator, a TOS ROM image is needed.  EmuTOS, a free
implementation of TOS, is shipped with the official releases of
Hatari.

This tos.img ROM image is identical to the official binary package of
EmuTOS, which is available at the SourceForge website of EmuTOS.  For
downloading other versions or the source code of EmuTOS, please visit
the EmuTOS website.

The tos.img file included with the latest Hatari releases is
the etos512k.img[1] from a preceeding EmuTOS release:
- Hatari v1.7.0:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/emutos/files/emutos/0.9.0/
- Hatari v1.6.2:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/emutos/files/emutos/0.8.7/
- Hatari v1.6.0:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/emutos/files/emutos/0.8.6/
- Hatari v1.4.0, v1.5.0:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/emutos/files/emutos/0.8.5/
- Hatari v1.1.0, v1.2.0, v1.3.0, v1.3.1:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/emutos/files/emutos/0.8.4/
- Hatari v1.0.0, v1.0.1:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/emutos/files/emutos/0.8.3/
- Hatari v0.95:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/emutos/files/emutos/0.8.2/

Earlier Hatari binary releases have included one of the smaller
EmuTOS image files.

[1] the "all languages" version intended mainly for TT & Falcon.
    While the 192k and 256k version on some cases work better
    for ST and STE programs, only the 512k image contains
    support for all the hardware and languages.

Note for EmuTOS before 0.8.6:
  In order to work with Hatari, EmuTOS 0.8.5 and earlier require
  the FastBoot option to be enabled. This is used to skip some memory
  tests (that Hatari doesn't support yet) when EmuTOS tries to
  determine the available RAM size.


What is EmuTOS
==============

EmuTOS is a single-user single-tasking operating system for the 32-bit
Atari computers and emulators.  It can be used as a replacement for
the TOS images typically needed today for using the emulators and it is
also running on some real hardware, like the Atari Mega STE and Atari
ColdFire.  All the source code is open and free, licensed under the
GNU General Public License (GPL).  A copy of the GNU GPL can be found
in the gpl.txt file.

EmuTOS has its home at SourceForge:
       http://sourceforge.net/projects/emutos


EmuTOS usage
============

There are various reasons for using EmuTOS instead of the original
TOS ROM images:

* Users who don't have Atari HW or other legal means to obtain the
  original Atari TOS ROMs (for all of the Hatari supported Atari
  versions: ST/STE/TT/Falcon), but would like to try out Hatari and
  see what kind of software the Atari machines had.  EmuTOS gives
  them a legal way to test Hatari with free demos, games etc.

* Users who want to continue using Atari compatible operating systems
  and need an open source replacement of TOS for modifications. Beside
  EmuTOS they typically alse use FreeMiNT, XaAES and fVDI as operating
  system replacements/improvements.

* This includes users of new "Atari" machines like Atari ColdFire project,
  which isn't 100% compatible at HW level to the original Atari machines:
	http://acp.atari.org/

* EmuTOS also allows using ACSI disk images with Hatari TT/Falcon
  emulation, whereas TOS 3 & 4 support only IDE and SCSI disks.
  Hard disk images are needed mainly for running MiNT.


EmuTOS compatibility
====================

These comments apply to EmuTOS v0.8.x.

Many commercial games and applications work fine with EmuTOS. This is
because games (like Bombjack, Nebulus, Oids, Super Hang-On, Turrican,
Xenon...) use directly the hardware which Hatari emulates just fine
and applications use the correct higher level APIs (AES/VDI) for which
EmuTOS has implementations.

EmuTOS AES support is somewhat buggy (mouse clicks and dragging
doesn't always work properly) and VDI support is slowish. Anybody
wanting proper AES/VDI support should install replacement for these,
either the free XaAES + fVDI, or the earlier commercial solutions like
NVDI.

Free games have the issue that some of them use the Line-A functionality
which is not supported by EmuTOS[1] unlike AES/VDI.  This is partly a
problem with the tools that they've been done with (for example older
STOS and GFA basic version liked to use Line-A for graphics). There
are also many old demos which use it for convenience.

[1] EmuTOS has some old/partial implementations for some of the Line-A
    functionality, but these are so buggy that they aren't enabled in
    EmuTOS releases except for mouse on/off functionality.

Joystick doesn't work in some (STOS) games that access it through
other means than XBIOS function Kbdvbase() or by hooking into the IKBD
interrupt vector.  They probably use some unofficial system variables
which location depends on the TOS version.


Debugging issues with EmuTOS
============================

EmuTOS debug output and debug symbols
-------------------------------------

To get extra debug output from EmuTOS, or add your own debug
statements, you need to recompile it from the source after enabling
the MIDI debug output in its config.h header file. Then start Hatari
with the "--midi-out /dev/stderr" option and you will see there the
EmuTOS debug output (such as calls to missing Line-A functions).

By loading the etos512k.sym EmuTOS debug symbols file coming with the
512k EmuTOS image, you can also ask debugger to "trace cpu_symbols" to
get trace of all the function calls EmuTOS does.

For other EmuTOS versions, there's a script[1] you can use to convert
the emutos2.map file (produced during EmuTOS build) to a format you
can load to Hatari debugger with its "symbols" command[2].

[1] http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=29381777
[2] http://hg.tuxfamily.org/mercurialroot/hatari/hatari/raw-file/tip/doc/manual.html#Debug_symbols

If you've compiled EmuTOS with AHCC[3] instead of GCC, you can get
suitable symbols with its "-n" linker flag, or you can use a script
coming with Hatari (ahcc-symbols-convert.sh) to convert AHCC *.map
file to a format supported by the Hatari debugger.

[3] AHCC: http://members.chello.nl/h.robbers/

After loading the symbols to the Hatari debugger, disassembling the
problematic address should provide more clues for the problem.  Or you
can just look up the program counter value given in the EmuTOS panic
message from the map file.

Debugging OS calls, Line-A usage and panics
-------------------------------------------

When debugging EmuTOS panics, the best option is to start Hatari with
"--bios-intercept --conout 2" (to enable Bios / XBios call tracking &
to redirect EmuTOS panic etc messages to console) and then ask Hatari
debugger to stop when the program is started:
-----------
> b pc=TEXT
CPU condition breakpoint 1 with 1 condition(s) added:
pc = TEXT
> c
Returning to emulation...
-----------
(In above example '>' indicates what you type to debugger.)

Then when the debugger is invoked at program startup, you can ask it to:
- collect CPU instruction history,
- break on exceptions that trigger the panic,
- load symbols and profile what happens as this will
  provide EmuTOS callstack when debugger is entered, and
- trace all OS calls and line-A opcodes leading to the panic
with:
-----------
> history on
> setopt -D
Exception debugging enabled.
> symbols etos512k.sym
> profile on
> trace os_all
> b LineAOpcode ! LineAOpcode :trace
CPU condition breakpoint 2 with 1 condition(s) added:
LineAOpcode ! LineAOpcode
-> Track value changes, show value(s) when matched.
-> Trace instead of breaking, but show still hits.
> c
Returning to emulation...
-----------

So that when the exception causing the panic triggers the debug, you
see EmuTOS callstack and the OS calls & line-A opcodes leading to it,
and have a panic message on console from which you can copy&paste
relevant parts.

You can then ask what the register values are at that point and what
are the CPU instructions leading to it with the "r" and "history"
commands. Memory state and addresses accessed by the instructions can
be inspected with the "m" command.

For more info on Hatari debugger usage, see the Hatari manual section
on it:
http://hg.tuxfamily.org/mercurialroot/hatari/hatari/raw-file/tip/doc/manual.html#The_debugger

Debugging freezes
-----------------

Hatari profiling support can be used to debug OS freezes.  If EmuTOS gets
stuck, just profile it for a while and then ask debugger for a profile
that tells where it's looping.  Then disassemble that part with symbols
directly in Hatari.


EmuTOS compatibility lists
==========================

The compatibility lists below cater mainly for users who don't have
Atari HW and therefore won't have (legal) version of commercial Atari
software and most likely lack motivation to investigate applications
very deeply (Linux offers better alternatives nowadays for most of
that). I.e. the lists skip commercial software and concentrate on
EmuTOS compatibility of freely available games and demos, or commercial
ones that have been released later on for free distribution.

Games that are considered good quality & fun, are marked with "*".
All the listed demos are quite OK. Most demos can be downloaded from:
	http://pouet.net/

First are listed ST demos, games graphics and MIDI applications,
then STE demos, games and music applications, then TT programs
and last Falcon demos, games and (mostly music) applications.


Working free/shareware Atari ST demos and games
-----------------------------------------------

There are so many freely available color games and demos that from
those only the ones found working with EmuTOS are listed. Often the
non-working ones "Panic" EmuTOS.

For best compatibility with ST emulation, one should use 192kB
or 256kB version of EmuTOS.

Non-working free/shareware GEM/mono Atari ST games
--------------------------------------------------

Although there are plenty of color demos and games, the number of
(even remotely fun) free GEM or monochrome games and demos is so low
that for those I list here non-working ones.  Typically the issues
are either use of unsupported line-A functions or with user input.

GEM games:
- Abalone   (dragging doesn't work)
- Anduril   ('h' and 'j' keys don't work)
- Bombs     (minesweeper, mouse clicks almost never work)
- Checkers  (dragging doesn't work)

- Risky*    (dragging doesn't work)
- Yams      (minesweeper, mouse clicks don't work)
- Yukon*    (dragging doesn't work)

Games that mix GEM UI and non-VDI drawing:
- Backgam   (line-A bitblit)
- Fishes    (line-A line and filled rectangle)
- Robugs*   (line-A filled rectangle and draw sprite)

Mono games:
- Big Blow      (line-A bitblit)
- Crystal Caves* (line-A bitblit and draw/clear sprite)

- Minigolf*     (line-A draw/clear sprite)
- Pacballs      (line-A bitblit + panic)
- Pipeline*	(line-A line and filled rectangle)
- Pling II	(line-A bitblit and draw/clear sprite)
- Ramses*       (causes panic as it tries to do crazy things with v_hide_c)
- Roll X	(line-A bitblit and get pixel)
- Take2*        (line-A bitblit)


Atari ST drawing programs / image viewers
-----------------------------------------

Working:
- iffcnv, IFF convertor/viewer
- spslide, Spec512 viewer
- ImCon v1.1, image converter/viewer
- Photochrome v4 (all buttons don't work)

Not working:
- Neochrome master (uses most of line-A functions)
- Speed of Light v3.8 (complains of not supporting TrueColor and exits)

----------------------

Working:
- Dr T's KCS v4
- Dr T's Tiger Cub v2.0
- EditTrack
- EZ-Score
- Henry Cosh's Accompanist
- Ludwig
- Sequencer One

Not working:
- Cubase lite (guesses etv_timer vector wrong -> panic)
- FinalCut Pro demo (panic on MIDI play)
- Music Mouse (uses line-A hline for cursor)

MIDI programs are available from Tim's MIDI world:
	http://tamw.atari-users.net/


Working free/shareware Atari STE programs
-----------------------------------------

There are not that many freely available or even commercial programs
that would be STE specific (or even STE enhanced):
    http://atari-ste.anvil-soft.com/html/archivapps.htm

But following STE specific & enhanced demos, games and apps work
(mostly) fine with EmuTOS.

Note: STE emulation needs 256kB version of EmuTOS.  If you use 60Hz
EmuTOS version (etos256us.img), you may get screen flicker and music
playback issues with demos and games.

the 512kB EmuTOS version.


"Almost" working color Atari STE programs
-----------------------------------------

There are some STE (enhanced) programs that would appear otherwise to
work perfectly, but some part of the graphics just don't show.  They
are listed in case someone, someday, starts to fix the EmuTOS line-A
things (mainly bitblt), or fixes the games to use e.g. VDI.

- Alien Thing preview (no-line A functions, but all sprites are missing,
  in EmuTOS v0.9.0, fire doesn't start the game anymore)
- Art for Kids (line-A sprite enable function -> cursor doesn't show;
  rectangle drawing -> screen corruption + panic)
- Atari Scene Card Battle (card images missing due to line-A bitblit)
- AttackWave (most graphics missing due to line-A bitblit)
- Blat (main graphics missing due to line-A bitblit)
- Breakdance (another scene game, game freezes when playing)
- Cameleon (all graphics missing due to line-A bitblit) 
- Mr Boomer (graphics missing due to Line-A bitblit and no music)
- H Mec 2 (no graphics due to line-A bitblit)
- Kolmik (tiles don't show due to line-A bitblit)
- Poker Square (graphics don't show due to line-A bitblit)
- Pooz (graphics don't show due to line-A bitblit)
- R0x (main menu graphics don't show due to line-A bitblit)
- Roger (no graphics except bg show, line-A bitblits)

Several of these (and Falcon) games are by Paradize:

Falcon free/shareware demos, games and applications
---------------------------------------------------

Falcon emulation requires 512kB version of EmuTOS
(the one shipped with Hatari).

Latest EmuTOS missing:
- HiColor support
- DSP XBios functions

probably explains partly why graphics in many of the demos & games
look broken, their sound or music doesn't work or they freeze at
startup.

(Latest EmuTOS release, v0.9.0, misses also 256-color and Falcon
sound matrix support.)

Games working with extra hacks:
- Bugger, Bunion, SkyFall, Sworm games by Resorvoir Gods:
  - use an undocumented TOS4 vector for keyboard input instead of accessing
    kbdvec correctly which use causes EmuTOS to panic.  This can be worked
    around with the following hack.prg:
    http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=26841274
  - with EmuTOS, enabling DSP freezes the games right at startup
    (with normal TOS4, DSP is used for background music)

Games that might be possible to get working (they
show something and/or don't use DSP/sound matrix):
- Block Blizzard preview: stops when loading
- Bomb Squad: crashes to bus error wget at 00fc0002
