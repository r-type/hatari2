<a name="Introduction"></a><h2>Introduction</h2>

<a name="General description"></a><h3>General description</h3>
<p>
Hatari is an Atari ST, STE, TT and Falcon emulator for Linux, FreeBSD, BeOS and
other Systems which are supported by the SDL library.
The emulator is open source software and is distributed under the terms of the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GNU General
Public License (GPL)</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Atari ST was a 16/32 bit computer system which was first released by Atari
in 1985. Using the Motorola 68000 CPU, it was a very popular computer having
quite a lot of CPU power at that time. See Appendix B for details on emulation
in general.
</p>
<p>
Unlike many other Atari ST emulators which try to give you a good
environment for running GEM applications, Hatari tries to emulate the hardware
of a ST as close as possible so that it is able to run most of the old ST games
and demos. Of course you can run normal GEM applications with Hatari, too.
Recent versions of Hatari even feature basic STE, TT and Falcon emulation.
</p>

to be affected by them.</p>


<a name="System requirements"></a><h3>System requirements</h3>

<p> Hatari currently has the following system requirements: </p>
<ul>
  <li>a fast PC (&gt;500MHz, for Falcon and TT emulation
      <a href="#Performance">even faster</a>)</li>
  <li>some sort of Unix (preferable <a href="http://www.linux.org/">GNU/Linux</a>)
  </li>
  <li>the SDL library (<a href="http://www.libsdl.org/">http://www.libsdl.org/</a>)</li>
  <li>the zLib (<a href="http://www.gzip.org/zlib/">http://www.gzip.org/zlib/</a>)
      for support of ZIP-packed disk images (*.zip and *.gz)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Certain versions of Hatari have successfully been tested by various people on
the following systems:

  <li>Linux/ARM (oabi) on Sharp Zaurus SL-C760 PDA</li>
  <li>Linux/ARM (eabi) on Nokia Maemo Internet Tablets and N900 phone</li>
</ul>

<a name="Compiling and running"></a><h2>Compiling and running</h2>

<a name="Compiling Hatari"></a><h3>Compiling Hatari</h3>

<p> First, you need the SDL library, you can get it at:
<a href="http://www.libsdl.org/">http://www.libsdl.org/</a>. Most
distributions already ship a suitable version.
Make sure to install the appropriate header files as well often called
"libsdl-dev" or the like.
</p>
<p> Second, you need the zLib compression library. You can get it from <a
 href="http://www.gzip.org/zlib/">http://www.gzip.org/zlib/</a>
but the version shipped with your distribution will be sufficient in
most cases. Make sure to have the header files
for it installed as well.
</p>
<p>
For optional features like PNG format screenshots and Hatari window
embedding, you need to have the header files for libpng and libX11.
For Falcon microphone recording support portaudio library is needed.
</p>
<p>
Of course, you need the GNU C compiler and (GNU) Make, too!
</p>
<p> Change to the <span class="file">hatari/</span> directory, copy
<span class="file">Makefile-default.cnf</span> to
<span class="file">Makefile.cnf</span> and adapt the configuration file
to suite your system. Alternatively, you can use the supplied configure
script to auto-detect all parameters (type
"<span class="commandline">./configure --help</span>"
to see the options of the script).
Don't forget to use some good CFLAGS for the compiler optimizations, e.g.
run <span class="commandline">configure</span> in the following way:
</p>
<pre>
CFLAGS="-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer" ./configure
</pre>
<p>
Then compile Hatari by typing <span class="commandline">make</span>.
If all
works fine, you'll get the executable <span class="commandline">hatari</span>
in the src/ subdirectory.
</p>

<a name="Installation of a TOS ROM"></a><h3>Installation of a TOS ROM</h3>

<p>
Before you can start Hatari, you have to copy a TOS ROM image to the data
directory (the data directory is specified
in the configuration file <span class="file">Makefile.cnf</span>) and
rename it to <span class="commandline">tos.img</span>, or use the
<span class="commandline">--tos</span> command line option to tell
Hatari where to find a TOS ROM.
Hatari needs a TOS ROM image because this contains the operating system
of the emulated Atari.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately it is not possible to ship an original ROM
image with the Hatari package since these images are still copyrighted.
But you can easily create an image with a real ST and one of those various
ROM-image programs for the ST (search for "TOSDUMP" with your
favourite internet search engine). If your old ST does not work anymore, you
can also try to search the internet directly for corresponding TOS ROM image,
but don't ask the Hatari team where to get one. </p>
<p> Another solution is EmuTOS, which is also shipped with the official
release versions of Hatari. EmuTOS is an open-source TOS clone. You can find
it at:
<a href="http://emutos.sourceforge.net/">http://emutos.sourceforge.net/</a>.
It is not the best solution for playing games or running other old software
due to compatibility issues (see <span class="file">emutos.txt</span> for
more details), but it's free and compatible with Hatari.</p>
<p>If you do not specify a TOS image on the commandline nor can Hatari
find a suitable TOS image in the default dir, you'll get the chance to
select a TOS image file from the GUI. </p>

<a name="Installation of the binary"></a><h3>Installation of the binary</h3>

<p> Type <span class="commandline">make install</span> as root to do a
systemwide installation. In this case it is recommended
to set the DATADIR variable in Makefile.cnf to a proper value. <tt>/usr/local/share/hatari</tt>
is a good value in that case.</p>
<p>The Hatari executable should now be in your PATH and accessible from
anywhere.</p>
<p> When you finally have got a TOS image, try starting Hatari with the
option <span class="commandline">--help</span> to find out more about
its command line parameters. </p>

<a name="Running Hatari for the first time"></a><h3>Running Hatari for the first time</h3>

<p> Now type <span class="commandline">hatari</span> to run the
emulator for the first time. If all goes
well, you should now be presented with a window showing you the
familiar
little green desktop of the Atari ST. Press <span class="key">F12</span>
to turn on the GUI to
configure Hatari to suit your needs, press <span class="key">F11</span>
to toggle windowed and fullscreen mode. </p>

<a name="Command line options"></a><h2>Command line options
and arguments</h2>

<p>Usage:</p>
<pre>
 hatari [options] [disk image | directory | Atari program ]
</pre>

<p>As an argument one can give either a name of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A floppy disk image,
<li>A directory that should be emulated as a virtual GEMDOS hard disk, or</li>
<li>An Atari program that should be autostarted.  In this case
    the program's directory will be used as the C: drive from
    where this program will be started.
    (Note that autostarting a program might not work if you've also
    specified a floppy image for drive A: on command line or in config
    file which contains a desktop.inf/newdesk.inf/emutos.inf file on
    it.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Booting will be done from the disk image or directory that's given
last on the command line as an option or the argument (and which
corresponds to A: or C:).</p>

<p>Hatari command line options are split into several categories:</p>

SDL's sound buffer size : 10-100, or 0 to use default buffer size.
By default Hatari uses an SDL buffer size of 1024 samples, which
gives approximatively 20-30 ms of sound depending on the chosen sound
frequency. Under some OS or with not fully supported sound card, this
default setting can cause a bigger delay at lower frequency (nearly 0.5 sec).
In that case, you can use this option to force the size of the sound
buffer to a fixed number of milliseconds of sound (using 20 is often
a good choice if you have such problems). Most users will not need this option.

<div class="floatimage">
<img src="images/system.png" width="360" height="384" alt="Hatari's GUI - the system dialog">
</div>

<p>
 First you can select the CPU type here. Here are some important hints for
 choosing the correct CPU type:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Atari ST and STE have only been shipped with a 68000 CPU, so for best
  compatibility with old programs, choose this CPU type.
 </li>
 <li>
  Atari TT and Falcon computers were using the 68030 CPU, so you should switch
  use 68EC030+FPU (Hatari doesn't support 030 with MMU and some programs don't
  work with 68020 so this is the best choice).
 </li>
 <li>
  TOS 1.0x only works with 68000, while TOS 3.0x and 4.0x work only with a CPU
  &gt;= 68020.
 </li>
 <li>
  68010 and 68040 have never been used in official Atari computers, so don't
  use these CPU types unless you've got some good reasons.
 </li>
</ul>

<p>
 Beside the CPU type, you can also choose the machine type to emulate.
 The ST was the very first 16/32-bit computer from Atari. Most older games
 and demos require an ST. The STE was introduced some years later and had
 some more advanced hardware features. There are not that many demos or
 games that really require an STE but since most normal ST games/demos also
 work with an STE, it's normally safe to always work in STE mode.
 <br>
 TT and Falcon are more advanced, but they are not as compatible to the ST as
 the STE was. Therefore many old games and demos do not work with these machine
 types anymore. There were only very few programs that were made for the TT
 exclusively, while there were some interesting games and demos specially made
 for the Falcon.
 <em>Note:</em> TT and Falcon emulation are incomplete. They may not work
 very well.
</p>
<p>
 For STE emulation a STE compatible TOS image, e.q. version 1.06, 1.62 or
 2.x, is strongly recommended. For TT emulation you need TOS 3.0x and for Falcon
 emulation you need TOS 4.0x. EmuTOS can be used on all machine types.
</p>
<p>
 Select the CPU clock you want to use. 8Mhz is ST standard and the most
 compatible. Use 16MHz for Mega STE and Falcon emulation.
 The CPU in the TT was clocked with 32 MHz.
</p>
<p>With the "Slower but more compatible CPU" option, you can enable
 the emulation of 68k address errors and the CPU prefetch buffer. This is needed
 for best compatibility, but it slows down emulation a little bit so you can
 disable it if you don't need it.</p>
<p>
 For Falcon mode, you can choose whether you want to enable DSP emulation,
 fake it or completely disable it. Most Falcon programs only play sound or work
 correctly when you enable the DSP emulation, but it needs a lot of host CPU
 power (more than 2 GHz). So if you have a slow host CPU, you can try if your
 Falcon program also runs with DSP disabled or in "dummy" mode.
 Note that you can not change this option while the DSP based program already
 runs.
</p>
<p>You can also enable/disable Blitter emulation here. The Blitter is a custom
 chip that accelerates some graphical operations. This switch only toggles the
 Blitter in plain ST mode. In STE mode, the Blitter is always enabled (since all
 STEs have been sold with a Blitter chip).</p>
<p>If you enable the "Real time clock emulation" switch, a RTC will
 be emulated based on the time of the host computer. Note that you need at least
 TOS 1.02 for proper RTC emulation, TOS 1.00 does not support this.</p>
<p>The Timer-D patch changes the Timer-D initialization from TOS. TOS uses
 the MFP timer D as a baudrate generator for RS232. However, the TOS default
 value slows down the emulation. The patch gives you a better performance.
 It is normally safe to enable the patch, but if you encounter a program that
 does not work, you can try to disable the patch to see if it works then.</p>
<p><em>NOTE:</em> The emulated Atari is very very sensitive to these options
 and it is strongly recommended to reset the emulation after changing
 them (for most things that's done automatically).   The correct
 CPU type and clock are automatically selected when one uses the
 <span class="commandline">--machine</span> command line option.</p>


<a name="The Floppy Disks Dialog"></a><h4 class="gui">The Floppy Disks Dialog</h4>

<div class="floatimage">
<img src="images/floppydisks.png" width="640" height="320" alt="Hatari's GUI - the floppy disks dialog">
</div>

<p>
 This dialog can be used to choose which floppy disks should be emulated
 in the disk drives. You can use most standard Atari ST disk image files.
 You may select and browse also zipped disk images. See the chapter
 <a href="#Floppy disk images">"Floppy disk images"</a> for details.
</p>
<p>
 Click on the button <span class="button">Browse</span> next to the
 A: and B: option to go to the fileselector to choose a disk image for the
 corresponding drive.
</p>
<p>Click on <span class="button">Eject</span> to eject a disk image
from the emulated drive. The emulated ST will act as if had no floppy
disk in its drive.</p>
<p>You can specify a default directory where Hatari will start to
browse the filesystem.</p>
<p>
Check the "Auto insert B" option if you want Hatari to be smart and
insert the second disk of a two disk game automatically.
Some games then use the second drive automatically.
In the case that a game is not able to find the disk in the second drive,
you have to insert the second disk in drive A: manually when prompted.
<br>
<em>NOTE:</em> This option only works properly if the file name of the
first disks ends with an 'a' before the extension and the second disk name
ends with a 'b'.
</p>
<p>
 Select if you want to use slow FDC (Floppy Disk Controller) emulation.
 "Slow floppy access" is normally not required, except for some few
 slideshows / intros which run too fast without this option.
</p>
<p>
 You can choose if you want Hatari to write-protect your disks. Atari ST virii
 can spread on disk images too so it might be a good idea to enable the write
 protection option. However you can't save highscores or games to your disk
 images in that case.
</p>

<div class="floatimage">
<img src="images/newfloppy.png" width="290" height="224" alt="Hatari's GUI - the new floppy dialog">
</div>

<p>
 If you need to create a new blank disk image, click on
 <span class="button">Create&nbsp;blank&nbsp;image</span>.
 Parameters for the new image can be set in the following dialog.
 HD and ED disk sector counts are for non-Atari disk sizes, but such
 disks are useful for programs that don't work with GEMDOS emulation.
 Click on <span class="button">Create</span> to save the new image or on
 <span class="button">Back</span> to return to the disk dialog.
</p>
<p>
 After clicking <span class="button">Create</span>, a fileselector
 appears. You can browse the filesystem now. Select the target directory,
 click beside "File:" and type in a name for the new disk image.
 The name should terminate with .st or .msa.
</p>
<p>
 Hatari can currently create plain .ST and .MSA disk images exclusively.
 <span class="commandline">hmsa</span> command line utility can be used
 to convert disk images between .ST and .MSA formats.
</p>


<a name="The Hard Disks Dialog"></a><h4 class="gui">The Hard Disks Dialog</h4>

<div class="floatimage">
<img src="images/harddisks.png" width="640" height="304" alt="Hatari's GUI - the hard disks dialog">
</div>

<p>
 This dialog can be used to change the harddisk settings.
</p>
<p>
 You can select a harddrive image for ACSI, IDE master or slave hard drive
 emulation via image file here or you may select a directory of your local
 filesystem to be emulated as the harddrive of the emulated system.
</p>
<p>
 Check "Boot from HD" if you want Hatari to execute the AUTO folder
 on the harddrive.
 This option is checked by default if you specify a harddrive image or
 a directory via the command line.
</p>
<p>
 Removing the check from the "Allow GEMDOS drive modification" option
 will prevent Atari programs from modifying the files in GEMDOS HDD
 emulation directory or creating new files under it.
</p>
<p>
 Note that for IDE hard disk emulation you also need a TOS version &gt;= 2.05.
 And ACSI hard disk emulation does not work with TOS 4.0x in Falcon mode.
</p>


<a name="The Memory Dialog"></a><h4 class="gui">The Memory Dialog</h4>

<div class="floatimage">
<img src="images/memory.png" width="398" height="349" alt="Hatari's GUI - the memory dialog">
</div>

<p>You can select the amount of RAM for the emulated ST here. Only
amounts that were valid on a real unmodified STFM can be selected.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> This option is critical and you are strongly advised
to reset the emulated ST
when changing this option.</p>
<p>Here you will find the options to save memory snapshots as well.</p>
<p>Click on <span class="button">Save</span> to save a memory snapshot
to file. You can select a new filename here.</p>
<p>Click on <span class="button">Restore</span> to restore a memory
snapshot from a file. Use the fileselector to select the snapshot to be
restored.</p>
<p><em>NOTE:</em> Memory snapshots are not interchangeable between
different versions of Hatari. E.q. if you compile a newer Hatari, you
cannot load your old memory snapshots back.</p>


<a name="The ROM Dialog"></a><h4 class="gui">The ROM Dialog</h4>

<div class="floatimage">
<img src="images/tos.png" width="519" height="367" alt="Hatari's GUI - the ROM dialog">
</div>

<p>Here you can select the TOS image to use. Click on <span
 class="button">Browse</span> to select it via the fileselector.
You can also select an optional cartridge image to use. Click on <span
 class="button">Browse</span> to select one via the fileselector. Click on <span
 class="button">Eject</span> to disconnect the custom cartridge image.
</p>
<p>
For ST mode, use TOS 1.00, 1.02, 1.04 or 2.06.
For STE mode, use TOS 1.06, 1.62, 2.05 or 2.06.
If you want to use the TT mode, you must specify a TOS 3.06 image here.
And in Falcon mode, you have to use either TOS 4.00, 4.02, 4.04 or 4.92.
However, you should always use TOS 4.04 for Falcon mode, it's the most common one.
Also note that TOS 4.92 can not be booted from a boot disk (like it's done on a
real Falcon), you have to specify it directly in the TOS ROM setup dialog here.
</p>
<p>
Keep in mind that any custom cartridge image will not work together with
GEMDOS hard disk emulation or the VDI extended resolution emulation
since some additional driver code will be used in the cartridge memory
space for these emulations.
</p>
<p>
<em>Note:</em> These options are critical and you are strongly
advised to reset the emulated ST
when changing one of these option.

<a name="The Joystick Dialog"></a><h4 class="gui">The Joystick Dialog</h4>

<div class="floatimage">
<img src="images/joystick.png" width="320" height="288" alt="Hatari's GUI - the joystick dialog">
</div>

<p>In this dialog, you can configure the emulated joysticks.
With the upper two arrows, you can choose the joystick which you want to
configure.</p>
<p>Joystick 1 is the normal ST joystick port and 99.9% of all ST games
use this port.
Joystick 0 emulates a joystick plugged into the ST mouse port
and is often used in games for two players.</p>
<p>With STE joypad A and B, you can enable the emulation of Jaguar joypads
which are plugged in the enhanced joystick ports of the Atari STE.
Only very few STE games support these joypads, so you often won't need this.</p>
<p>Finally, Hatari also emulates joysticks which were plugged on the parallel
port with a special adapter on a real ST. These were used in some few
multi-player games like "Gauntlet 2".</p>
<p>For each ST joystick, choose whether you want to disable it,
use the keyboard for emulation or use a real PC joystick.</p>
<p>For keyboard emulation, you can select the keys by pressing the
<span class="button">Define&nbsp;keys</span> button. You will be prompted to press
the keys for up, down, left, right and fire.</p>
<p>If you want to use a real PC joystick for the emulation, you should connect
it to your PC before you start Hatari. Then you can choose the joystick with
the two lower arrows.</p>
<p>Check the "Enable autofire" option if you are too lazy to pound
on the fire button in shoot'em-up games. However, this option only works with
certain games. In some other games, it gets worse if you enable this option.</p>
<p>See also the chapter "Emulated Joystick" for details.</p>

 Here you control the video output of the emulated Atari.
</p>
<p>
 You can select which sort of monitor to use. This option depends on
 the machine type which you have selected in the "System options"
 dialog. In ST and STE mode, you can choose between monochrome mode
 (select "Mono") and color mode (select one of the other monitor types).
 Note that when you select "TV" and use zoomed low resolution or
 switch to ST medium resolution, you will get a TV-like screen rendering
 which is a little bit faster but darker compared to the normal "RGB"
 monitor mode. Switching between mono and a color monitor acts like a monitor
 switch on a real ST - so beware, this will reboot your emulated system!<br>
 In TT mode, you can only choose between TT-high resolution ("Mono")
 and normal modes (select one of the other monitor types).
 Finally the Falcon mode supports all four types of monitors. Note that most
 Falcon demos/games require a RGB or TV mode and do not work with VGA.
</p>
<p>
 "Show ST/STE borders" toggles the displaying of the borders around the ST /
 STE screen. Some demos and games use the screen borders for displaying
 additional graphics. As enabling this option increases CPU computing time,
 don't enable it if you have a very slow computer.
 This option affects only the ST and STE modes, TT and Falcon modes are
 always displayed without borders.
</p>
<p>
Extended VDI resolutions will emulate a sort of extended graphics
card in the emulated ST which give you larger resolutions with a higher
colordepth for GEM. Select a resolution and color depth. Check to
activate. It will disable all other video options mentioned above.
Uncheck to get back to a normal ST behaviour.<br>
<em>Note:</em> Using an extended resolution will only work with GEM
conformant applications. 99% of all games and demos will not run if you
activate any extended resolution here.

<a name="The Hatari Screen Dialog"></a><h4 class="gui">The Hatari
Screen Dialog</h4>

<div class="floatimage">
<img src="images/screen.png" width="520" height="320" alt="Hatari's
GUI - the Hatari screen dialog">
</div>

<p>
Here you control how the video output of the emulated Atari appears
on your screen.
</p>

<p>
 Check "Fullscreen" to run Hatari in fullscreen.  By default Hatari
 runs in windowed mode.
</p>
<p>
 The "Frame Skip" option can be used to speed up the emulator
 if it is running too slow on your system. Disable frame-skip if you have
 a fast computer. When selecting 1, 2 or 4, drawing of corresponding number
 of frames will be skipped after each frame actually shown by Hatari.
 Select "Auto" to let the emulator to decide whether, and
 how many frames will be skipped.<br>
 <em>Note:</em> The frameskip option also affects the frame rate of the
 screen animation recording!
</p>
<p>
Indicators that you can have on the Hatari window:
<ul>
<li>"Statusbar" at the bottom of the screen.
The statusbar shows the floppy drive LEDs, the current frameskip value,
the machine type including TOS version and memory size, and whether
recording is currently active.</li>
<li>"Drive led" is a colored rectangle shown on top of the Hatari window
contents. It will show any disk (floppy or hard disk) activity.</li>
<li>"None" turns both of above options off.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
"Keep desktop resolution" option will use your desktop resolution
for fullscreen to avoid issues related to resolution switching,
especially on LCD monitors (they're slow).  If this isn't enabled,
values from the "Max zoomed win" option are used in selecting
a suitable resolution.
<p>
"Max zoomed win" option controls up to which size Hatari tries to scale
the Atari resolutions and how much of the borders (enabled in Atari
Monitor dialog) will be shown.  Note that there are several limitations
in this and the "Keep desktop resolution" option, partly because Hatari
has different implementations for different video modes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>VDI resolutions (selectable in Atari Monitor dialog) aren't scaled.</li>
<li>ST and STE video emulation supports only doubling of the ST-low
    resolution.</li>
<li>Hatari doesn't support downscaling. If the original Atari resolution
    is larger than the specified size (e.g. TT-high), the Hatari screen
    size will also be larger than requested.  Hatari Falcon/TT window size
    will be limited to the Desktop size though.</li>
<li>TT and Falcon resolutions support only <em>integer</em> scaling ratios.
    If the scaling ratio cannot match the requested size exactly, Hatari
    will use a ratio that will produce smaller size closest to the
    requested one.</li>
</ul>
<p>
You should set these values to a size that suits best your monitor
resolution. It's intended to help in getting Hatari to best use your
monitor space on a windowed mode and in fullscreen avoiding "fuzzy"
scaling done by your LCD monitor.
</p>
<p>
Giving "-z 2" option on command line will reset max zoomed size to
default values and "-z 1" will disable all zooming.
Note that zooming takes additional CPU computing time and should
not be enabled on very slow computers.
</p>
<p>Click the <span class="button">Screenshot</span> button to create
a screenshot in PNG (or BMP) format to the current working directory
or click the <span class="button">Record&nbsp;AVI</span> button to
record an AVI format video of Hatari screen (and audio) output.
</p>
<p>
Selecting "Crop statusbar" option will leave statusbar out from
the screenshots and recorded videos.

<div class="floatimage">

</div>

<p>Here you can select the keyboard mapping to use. Two different mappings
 called "Symbolic" and "Scancode" are predefined.</p>
<p>"Symbolic" tries to map the symbolic values of your PC keys
 to the ST keys. It should be working pretty good on all systems as long
 as your keyboard layout looks close to the standard english keyboard
 layout. However, you might experience some problems with special keys like
 brackets etc.</p>
<p>"Scancode" uses the scancode values of your PC keys for keyboard
 mapping. This only works on certain architectures like Linux where the
 scancodes are similar to the ST scancodes (e.g. it does not work on Mac OS X).
 If it works on your system, this often gives better results than the symbolic
 mapping. Note that you also need a TOS version with the right language
 (e.g. use a French TOS if you are using a French keyboard).</p>
<p>You can also load a custom keyboard mapping file here if you wish. Please
 note that the custom keyboard mapping will use the "symbolic"
 mapping for all keys that are not defined by your map file. Have a look
 at the supplied example mapfile (keymap-sample.txt) to see how to create
 your own keyboard mapping.</p>
<p>
 When the emulator runs in fast forward mode, and you want to type text,
 it can be annoying that the emulated system detects multiple key events
 due to the key repetition of the emulated system. To avoid this you can
 disable the key repetition in fast forward mode here.
</p>


<a name="The Sound Dialog"></a><h4 class="gui">The Sound Dialog</h4>

<div class="floatimage">
<img src="images/sound.png" width="380" height="383" alt="Hatari's GUI - the sound dialog">
</div>

<p>Here you can control the sound subsystem.</p>
<p>Check if you want emulated sound at all. Emulation is faster if
sound emulation is turned off.</p>
<p>
 Nine frequencies from low to high quality are available. Experiment a
 little bit to find out which fits best for your setup.
 For most modern computers, 44100 Hz or 48000 Hz should be fine.
 For older or slower host systems, you should use a lower frequency.
 12517, 250033 and 50066 Hz are frequencies supported by
 the STE/TT/Falcon sound DMA.
</p>
<p>
YM voice volume mixing "ST table" method uses a lookup table of audio output
voltage values measured on STF and "Linear" just averages the 3 YM voices.
</p>
<p>
 You can select to record a piece of sound here.
 Use the <span class="button">Browse</span> button to choose a file.
 The file name extension that you use (.WAV or .YM) determines in which format
 the sound is recorded in. The <span class="button">Record&nbsp;sound</span> button
 is a toggle so you will need to return to the GUI to switch sound recording off
 again (or to use the keyboard shortcut for that).

<a name="Emulated Atari ST keyboard"></a><h3>Emulated Atari ST keyboard</h3>

<p> All other keys on the keyboard act as the normal Atari ST keys so
pressing SPACE on your PC will result in an emulated press of the SPACE
key on the ST. The following keys have special meanings: </p>

      <td align="center">will emulate the ST's ) in the keypad</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>If joystick emulation via keyboard is enabled, by default cursor keys
are used for the directions and <span class="key">right CTRL</span> key
as the fire button. Otherwise they act as corresponding keys of the emulated
Atari ST.</p>

<p>NOTE: Problems with simultenous keypresses most likely aren't an
issue in Hatari as many modern keyboards report/support only three
simultenous key presses (or even just two depending on which keys
are in question).  Expensive gaming keyboards support more.</p>


<a name="Emulated mouse"></a><h3>Emulated mouse</h3>

<p>For obvious reasons your PC mouse will act as the emulated Atari ST
mouse. In fullscreen mode it will act as expected, directly controlling
the ST mouse pointer. </p>
<p>However it is a little bit different in windowed mode. To make the
mouse work there as expected you need to grab it first or lock it into
the Hatari window. Do this by pressing the <span class="key">ALTGR+m</span>
hotkey combination or starting Hatari with the
<span class="commandline">--grab</span> command line option.
Press the shortcut key (again) to go back to normal mouse behaviour
which allows you to move mouse outside outside the Hatari window while
Hatari is up and running. Note: pausing the emulation will also
(temporarily) release the mouse grab.</p>
<p>Mouse scrollwheel will act as cursor up and down keys. </p>

<a name="Emulated joystick"></a><h3>Emulated joystick</h3>

<p>The Atari ST joysticks are emulated ofcourse allowing you to play
your favourite games with Hatari. </p>
<p>The default mode is to use a connected PC joystick. You can use any
joystick that is supported by your kernel. If your joystick works with
other applications, it will likely work with Hatari as well. Make sure
it is calibrated and then off you go. Move the stick to point into the
desired direction. Please note that Hatari will not detect analogue
movement as the Atari ST only had digital joysticks. The first
firebutton will act as the normal firebutton on the Atari ST while the
second
firebutton will emulate a keypress of the <span class="key">SPACE</span>
key on the ST as many ST
games utilize the SPACE bar for secondary game functions. (Xenon for
example)</p>
<p>If you do not have a PC joystick or joypad, then you do not need to
desperate. You can emulate one of the two Atari ST joysticks via the
cursor keys. Just activate it in the GUI. Then the cursor keys will act
as the joystick directions, the right CTRL key will act as the
firebutton. You can still use the cursor keys as the ST's
cursorkeys in this mode as long as you press <span class="key">SHIFT</span>
along with the cursorkeys.  You can also configure these keys from the
joystick options.</p>

<a name="Emulated video"></a><h3>Emulated video</h3>

<p>Hatari emulates all screen modes of the original machine.</p>
<p>
ST/STE shifter overscan effects are emulated, but due to the fact
that these effects are achieved by using quirks and glitches in the
original chips to do things beyond their specification, emulation is
a bit tricky for these effects. As a result, some demos using these
techniques might not be displayed correctly in Hatari, known ones are
listed in the <span class="file">compatibility.html</span> file.
</p>
<p>Beside that you can setup extended VDI modes. These only work with
GEM-compliant applications and they are equal to fitting a videocard
into your Mega ST.</p>
<p>Make sure to disable extended VDI modes for playing games as 99% of
all ST games will not be able to make use of higher resolutions.</p>

<a name="Emulated printer"></a><h3>Emulated printer</h3>

<p>Due to the fact that printer handling is very different between Unix
style machines and the Atari ST, emulation
of the printer is achieved by writing all printer output to a file.</p>
<p>The file will contain a sequence of data, the same that would appear
on the data pins of the Atari ST printer port.
That would include control characters and commands for graphic
printing. Clicking "Print desktop" on the GEM desktop would result
in a messy data dump in the printer output.</p>
<p>Printer emulation works best for plain text files or programs that
do not format the output for a specific printer.
The file contents can be used with your favourite text editor for
further processing and printing to a real printer.</p>
<p>To get real direct printing out of Hatari on a PostScript printer,
you may set up a GDOS printer with a PostScript driver on the emulated
Atari and set your printer device file as Hatari's printer output.<br>
<em>NOTE:</em> This has not been tested yet and the Hatari team cannot
guarantee that it will work.</p>

<a name="Emulated RS232"></a><h3>Emulated RS232</h3>

<p>Serial communications in Hatari is designed to directly use a serial
port on your PC.</p>
<p>Communications parameters are set automatically upon the settings of
the emulated ST. This means all you do is to set
the communication parameters like baudrate from your ST communications
software. Hatari will do the rest and handle
the serial input and output for you.</p>

<a name="Floppy disk images"></a><h2>Floppy disk images</h2>

<p>Hatari does not use floppy disks directly but disk images due to
differences between the floppy disk controllers of the ST and the PC.
Three types of disk images are currently supported: The raw "ST" type,
the similar "DIM" type and
the compressed "MSA" (Magic-Shadow-Archiver) type. </p>
<p> The raw type (file suffix should be "*.st") is simply a sector by
sector image of a real floppy disk. You can easily create such an image
with the <span class="commandline">dd</span> program which should
normally be pre-installed on every
Unix-like system. Simply type something like <span class="commandline">dd
if=/dev/fd0 of=myimage.st</span> to create a disk image. Of course you
need access to
/dev/fd0, and depending on your system and the type of floppy disk you
might have to use another device name here (for example I use
/dev/fd0u720 for 720kB disks). However, if the disk is copy-protected
or
doesn't use a MSDOS compatible file system, this might fail. So be very
careful if you are not sure about the disk format. </p>
<p> The other possibility is to image the disk on a real Atari ST.
There
are programs like the Magic Shadow Archiver for this task. Hatari
supports this slightly compressed MSA disk images, too. Note that
Hatari
only supports the "old" MSA format, there are some Magic Shadow
Archiver
clones (like Jay-MSA) that create better compressed but
Hatari-incompatible disk images. However, if you have got such a MSA
disk and want to use it with Hatari, you can still run the
corresponding
MSA program within Hatari to extract the incompatible disk image to a
normal floppy disk image. </p>
<p> While *.ST and *.MSA are more or less the "standard" types of Atari
disk images, you might sometimes also find STT or ADF images on the
internet. These currently do not work with Hatari. </p>
<p>Hatari can now also utilize *.DIM images just as *.ST ones without
any problems.
Note that DIM images are nearly the same as the raw ST images
(they only have an additional 32 bytes header), so you can easily
transform
the DIM images into ST images by stripping the header from the files.
For example try something like:
<span class="commandline">dd if=input.dim of=output.st bs=32 skip=1</span>
</p>
<p> If you've got a disk image that has been created with the old ST
emulator PaCifiST (for DOS) or with early versions of the program
Makedisk, and the disk image does not work with Hatari, then the disk
probably suffers from the "PaCifiST bootsector bug" (Hatari will
display a
warning message then). In this case, the bootsector of the disk
contains some illegal data, so that the disk even does not work on a
real ST any more. However, if it is a .ST and not a .MSA disk, you can
easily fix it by using a hex-editor to change the byte at offset $D
(13)
from 0 to 1 (don't forget to backup your disk image first, since you
can also easily destroy your disk image when changing a wrong byte
there). If the disk contains a bootsector program, you probably have to
adjust the boot sector check sum, too (it can be found at offset $1FE +
$1FF). </p>
<p>Hatari supports disk images that are compressed with (Pk-)ZIP
(file suffix must be ".zip") or GZip (file suffix must be ".st.gz" or
".msa.gz"), so you can archive your disk images into zip archives.
You can also directly run the zip archives you may download from the
net as long as the archive contains a disk image in .ST or .MSA format.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Hatari does not save disk images back to *.ZIP files
so
your highscores and savegames are lost if you load the game from such
a zipped disk image.</p>


<a name="Hard disk support"></a><h2>Hard disk support</h2>

<p>
Hatari supports three ways of emulating Atari hard drives: The low-level
ACSI and IDE hard disk emulation and a GEMDOS based drive emulation.
In most cases the GEMDOS based hard disk emulation is best as it allows
exchanging files easily between the emulated and the host environment.
</p>
<p>
Please note that changing the HD-image or the GEMDOS HD-folder will reset
the emulated Atari since it is not possible to switch the hard disk
while the emulator is running.
</p>
<p>
On a 32-bit host system, the size of a hard disk image is limited to 2 GB.
On 64-bit host systems, bigger images might be possible but the support for
bigger images is not tested very well yet.
</p>


<a name="GEMDOS based hard disk emulation"></a><h3>GEMDOS based hard disk emulation</h3>
<p>
With the GEMDOS based drive emulation, you can easily "mount" a
folder from the host file system to a drive of the emulated Atari. To
use the GEMDOS based drive emulation, you should use a folder on your
hard disk that only contains files and folders with valid TOS
filenames i.e. file and folders names shouldn't contain invalid GEMDOS
filename characters and their length shouldn't exceed the 8+3 file name
length limit.
</p>
<p>
If you provide <span class="commandline">--harddisk</span> option
a directory containing only single letter subdirectories, each of
these subdirectories will be treated as a separate partition, otherwise
the given directory itself will be assigned to drive "C:". In the
multiple partition case, the letters used as the subdirectory names
will determine to which drives/partitions they're assigned.
</p>
<p>
GEMDOS drive emulation is an easy way to share files between the
host system and the emulated Atari, but there are also some known
limitations which are due to the way the GEMDOS drive emulation is
implemented:
</p>
<ul>
<li>It is not possible to use a cartridge image at the same time
with the GEMDOS drive emulation (Hatari has it's own cartridge code
that is used for GEMDOS emulation).</li>
<li>As MiNT installs its own GEMDOS handler, it doesn't work with
the GEMDOS drive emulation.  MiNT needs to be booted from a real hard
disk image.</li>
<li>GEMDOS drive emulation conflicts with the ACSI and IDE harddisk images.
If you want to use GEMDOS HD emulation and ACSI/IDE disk images together,
use a multiple partition GEMDOS emulation setup and select the partition
subdirectories (letters) so that they don't conflict with the ACSI/IDE
drive partitions (letters).  With HD Driver you have also another option,
see <a href="#Using HD Driver with GEMDOS partitions">Using HD Driver
with GEMDOS partitions</a>.</li>
<li><em>The GEMDOS drive emulation does not work (very well) with TOS
1.00 and 1.02</em>.  Use at least TOS 1.04 if you want the GEMDOS drive
emulation to work properly.</li>
</ul>
<p>
So, if your programs complain that they could not find/read/write
files on the GEMDOS emulated drive, you should try to copy them to a
floppy disk image or a real hard disk image!
</p>

<a name="ACSI hard disk emulation"></a><h3>ACSI hard disk emulation</h3>
<p>
To use the ACSI hard disk emulation, you need a hard disk image file
with a pre-installed HD driver in it. You can try to get an image of
your old ST hard disk or grab one from the internet (e.g. from the
Hatari website).
</p>
<p>
To create a <em>new</em> ACSI hard disk image, you can start with an empty
image that you have created for example with the following command:
<span class="commandline">dd if=/dev/zero of=hd.img bs=512 count=xxx</span>
(where 'xxx' is size in 512 byte blocks).  Copy the complete AHDI 5.0
package to a floppy disk image, then boot Hatari with this floppy disk
image and the fresh hard disk image like this:
<span class="commandline">--acsi hd.img ahdi.st</span>.
Then start HDX.PRG from the floppy disk and format + partition the hard
disk image with it.
</p>
<p>
Formatting and partitioning works currently only with AHDI 5, but you
can install the AHDI 6 driver to the hard disk after it's formatted.
Restart the emulated system, run AHDI.PRG from the floppy disk to access
the hard disk image from the emulated Atari and then run HINSTALL.PRG.
After installing the hard disk driver to the fresh HD image with
HINSTALL.PRG, you can boot directly from the hard disk image.
</p>

<a name="IDE hard disk emulation"></a><h3>IDE hard disk emulation</h3>
<p>
<p>
As the IDE disk format (little endian) differs from the ACSI disk format
(big endian), you need separate disk images for them.  Hatari doesn't
currently support formatting IDE disks with AHDI, but you can do it with
<em>Cecile</em>.
</p>
<p>
First create an empty image file with the size of your choice with:
<span class="commandline">dd if=/dev/zero of=hd.img bs=1k count=xxx</span>.
Then get the Cecile hard disk driver from
<a href="http://centek.free.fr/atari/softs/s_cecile.htm">http://centek.free.fr/atari/softs/s_cecile.htm</a>
and put it on a floppy disk image (e.g. to one named "cecile.st" using:
<span class="commandline">zip2st.sh cecile.zip</span>).
</p>
<p>
Run Hatari with
<span class="commandline">hatari --machine falcon --tos tos404.rom
--ide-master hd.img cecile.st</span>, switch to larger color resolution
and warm up your French language skills. Then start the Cecile hard
disk driver CECILE.PRG and run CC_TOOLS.APP to partition your hard
disk image. Click the "Partition" button, select "Hatari IDE disk" and set
suitable partition size with the arrows (below type field). Then click
"Valider".
</p>
<p>
If you only want to use your HD image in Falcon mode, you can install
the Cecile hard disk driver to the image from the Cecile CC_TOOLS.APP:
Click the "Installer" button and save the Cecile driver to the
1st partition on "Hatari IDE disk". If you want to also use your HD
image in ST/STE mode, you need to get and install AHDI 6 driver on it
instead (see <a href="ACSI hard disk emulation">ASCI hard disk
emulation</a> section).
</p>
<p>
Then you can boot from your hard disk image by simply specifying it
with the <span class="commandline">--ide-master</span> parameter.
</p>


<a name="Moving files to/from hard disk images"></a><h2>Moving files
to/from hard disk images</h2>

<p>Moving files to and from Atari hard disk images can be done
either through GEMDOS partitions (host directories mounted inside
Hatari emulation) or accessing the images directly on the host
(outside the emulation).  Both have their own limitations.</p>

<p>If it's fine for the IDE/ACSI partitions to be first, you can use
hard disk images with AHDI or Cecile driver and a multipartition
GEMDOS setup as described in above sections. If you want to boot from
a GEMDOS partition i.e. such to be before hard disk image partitions,
and still to be able to access all the IDE/ACSI partitions, you need to
use HD Driver.</p>

<a name="Using HD Driver with GEMDOS partitions"></a><h3>Using HD Driver
with GEMDOS partitions</h3>

<p>Uwe Seimet's <a href="http://www.seimet.de/atari/en/hddriver.html">HD
Driver</a> works fine with both the Hatari GEMDOS partitions and normal
hard disk images.  However, it doesn't work with EmuTOS so you need
real TOS (at least version v1.04).
</p>

<p>First copy the HDDRIVER.PRG binary into your GEMDOS drive emulation
directory AUTO folder. Then start the HDDRUTIL.APP configuration utility,
locate HDDRIVER.PRG, open the
<a href="http://www.seimet.de/atari/en/hddriverscreenshots.html">"Devices
and Partitions" dialog</a> and select the "Preserve Existing Partitions"
option.  Then you can just start Hatari with your hard disk image and
this GEMDOS directory, for example like this:
"<span class="commandline">hatari --harddisk gemdos-hd/ --ide-master
ide-hd.image</span>".</p>

<p>If you're using the <em>demo</em> version of HD Driver, you can
write files only to the C: partition, i.e. in above case only copy
files from the hard disk image partition to the GEMDOS partition (with
some write slowndowns included into the demo version). If you want to
copy files to the hard disk image with the <em>demo</em> version of
the HD Driver, you need to set the hard disk image as drive C:.</p>

<p>To accomplish this, set the GEMDOS partitions to be from D: forward,
i.e. have a directory which contains only single letter subdirectories,
starting from "D" like in "<span class="commandline">mkdir gemdos-hd;
mkdir gemdos-hd/D</span>". Then give Hatari (as the last parameter)
a boot floppy image containing the demo version of HDDRIVER.PRG in
its AUTO folder, like this: "<span class="commandline">hatari
--ide-master ide-hd.image --harddisk gemdos-hd/ hd-driver-floppy.st</span>".
</p>


<a name="Accessing HDD image partitions outside of Hatari"></a><h3>Accessing
HDD image partitions outside of Hatari</h3>

<p>
If you want to access the harddisk image partitions also outside
the emulation, the disk image needs to have a DOS partition table.
The <span class="commandline">atari-hd-image</span> script included
with Hatari can be used to create such an image.
</p>
<p>
Inside the Hatari emulator, EmuTOS can access partition(s) on these
kind of images directly without any driver software.  Of the Atari HD
drivers mentioned above, Centek's Cecile and Uwe Seimet's HD Driver
(demo) work fine with these partitions. E.g. AHDI and CBHD don't.
</p>
<p>
Note that plain EmuTOS supports only ACSI and the listed HD drivers
support only IDE (emulation). Cecile needs TT or Falcon and HD Driver
doesn't work with EmuTOS.  To summarise; if ASCI emulation and
EmuTOS are enough, use those. Otherwise, if you want to use TT or
Falcon emulation, use Cecile (or full HD Driver version if you have
it), otherwise use HD Driver (demo).
</p>
<p>
To access the content of the partitions on Linux host, there are two
possibilities:

<h4>Using Mtools</h4>
<p>
For this you need to add an entry for the hard disk
image to your <span class="commandline">~/.mtoolsrc</span> and
specify which partition you want to access from the image. For
an image created with the above mentioned script, the line in
the configuration file should look something like this:
</p>
<pre>
MTOOLS_NO_VFAT=1
drive c: file="/home/user/hatari/hd.img" partition=1
</pre>
<p>
Note that Mtools is instructed to use FAT compatibility mode because
EmuTOS cannot deal properly with VFAT file information.  If you don't
want this setting for all your Mtools drives, you can set it also via
the environment like this ("::" refers to the drive image given with
the "-i" option):
</p>
<pre>
MTOOLS_NO_VFAT=1 mcopy -spmv -i hd.img files/* ::
</pre>

<h4>Using a loopback device</h4>
<p>
This is recommended even by Mtools documentation, but it's less
convenient as it requires root rights. First you need to "loop"
mount the image:
</p>
<pre>
$ su
# image="hd.img"; mountdir="hd"
# start=$(parted $image unit s print | awk '/ 1 /{print $2}' | tr -d s)
# losetup -f $image -o $((512*$start))
# loop=$(losetup -a | tail -1 | cut -d: -f1)
# mkdir -p $mountdir
# mount -t msdos $loop $mountdir
</pre>
<p>
This uses <span class="commandline">parted</span> to find out the first
partition offset in sectors and then tells <span class="commandline">losetup</span>
to bind the first free loop device to a corresponding offset from
the <span class="commandline">hd.img</span> image.
<span class="commandline">mount</span> is then used to mount the file system
from the loop device on top of the "hd" directory.
</p>
<p>
After you've copied the relevant files to the "hd" directory, you need
unmount the file system and remove the loop device binding before using
the disk image from Hatari:
</p>
<pre>
# umount $mountdir
# losetup -d $loop
</pre>

<a name="The debugger"></a><h2>The debugger</h2>

<p>
Hatari has a built-in debugging interface which can be used for
analyzing code that runs in the emulated system. To invoke the
debugger, press the <span class="key">AltGr + Pause</span>
key combination.
</p>

<p>
If you start Hatari with the "-D" command line option, m68k
exceptions will automatically invoke the debugger. You can
toggle this also later from the debugger with the "setopt -D"
command.
</p>

<p>
To run debugger commands at Hatari startup, one can use the "--parse
&lt;file&gt;" command line option.  This is useful e.g. for debugging
TOS or some demo startup code, or if you always want to use some
specific debugger setup (breakpoints etc).
</p>

<p>
The debugger uses Hatari's parent console window, so make sure you run
Hatari from the command line when you want to use the debugger. On
Linux you can add for example an icon to your desktop that does it
with something like this (replace "xterm" with your favorite terminal
program):
</p>
<pre>
xterm -T "Hatari debug window" -e hatari
</pre>


<a name="General debugger use"></a><h3>General debugger use</h3>

<p>
At the debugger prompt, type "help" to get a list of all
the available commands and their shortcuts:
</p>
<pre>
Generic commands:
           cd (  ) : change directory
     evaluate ( e) : evaluate an expression
         help ( h) : print help
         info ( i) : show machine/OS information
         lock (  ) : specify information to show on entering the debugger
      logfile ( f) : open or close log file
        parse ( p) : get debugger commands from file
       setopt ( o) : set Hatari command line and debugger options
    stateload (  ) : restore emulation state
    statesave (  ) : save emulation state
        trace ( t) : select Hatari tracing settings
         quit ( q) : quit emulator

CPU commands:
      address ( a) : set CPU PC address breakpoints
   breakpoint ( b) : set/remove/list conditional CPU breakpoints
       disasm ( d) : disassemble from PC, or given address
      profile (  ) : profile CPU code

   dspmemdump (dm) : dump DSP memory
   dspsymbols (  ) : load DSP symbols & their addresses
   dspprofile (dp) : profile DSP code
       dspreg (dr) : read/write DSP registers
      dspcont (dc) : continue emulation / DSP single-stepping
</pre>

<a name="Entering arguments to debugger commands">
</a><h4>Entering arguments to debugger commands</h4>

<p>
After writing (with TAB completion) one of the above command names,
pressing TAB will (for most commands) show all the available subcommands.
</p>

<p>
If you want to give numbers in other number bases
than the default/selected one, they need to be prefixed with a
character indicating this.  For decimals this prefix is "#" (#15),
for hexadecimals "$" ($F), and for binary values it's "%" (%1111).
</p>

<p>
By default debugger expects all numbers without a prefix to be
decimals, but you can change the default number base with the "setopt"
command, just give it the desired default number base (bin/dec/hex).
<em>When using the hexadecimal number base, remember still to prefix
hexadecimal numbers with '$' if they could be confused with register
names (a0-7, d0-7)!</em>  Otherwise results from expressions and
conditional breakpoints can be unexpected.
</p>


<h4>Calculations and immediate evaluation</h4>

<p>
Instead of a number, you can also use an arithmetic expression, by
surrounding it with quotes ("").  An expression can contain
calculations with CPU and DSP register, symbol and Hatari variable
values in addition to numbers. For example to give a sum of A0 and
D0 register values to a command, use "a0+d0".
</p>

<p>
Within arithmetic expressions parenthesis are used both to change
the order of precendence <em>and</em> to indicate indirect addressing.
Unlike with conditional breakpoint expressions (explained below), you
cannot give size for the indirect addressing, a long value is always
read from the RAM address given within parenthesis.  For example to
get a long value pointed by stack pointer + 2, use "(a7+2)".
</p>

<p>
Values of arithmetic expressions are always evaluated before being
given to a command.  Except for "evaluate" and "address" commands,
they always need to be marked with quotes (""). Besides arithmetics,
this can be used also to give symbol/register/variable values to
commands that don't otherwise interpret them.  If command complains
that it didn't recognize e.g. a register name, just put it to quotes
and it will be "evaluated" before being given to the command.
</p>

<p>
With command argument completion (see <a href="#Build notes">build
notes</a>), result from the last "evaluate" command can be inserted
by typing '$' and pressing TAB.
</p>


<a name="Inspecting emulation state"></a><h3>Inspecting emulation state</h3>

<p>
In the beginning, probably the most interesting commands are "m" and "d"
for dumping and disassembling memory regions.  You can use "dm" and "dd"
commands to do the same for the DSP.
</p>
<pre>
&gt; help memdump
'memdump' or 'm' - dump memory
Usage:  m [start address-[end address]]
        dump memory at address or continue dump from previous address.
</pre>
<pre>
&gt; help disasm
'disasm' or 'd' - disassemble from PC, or given address
Usage:  d [start address-[end address]]
        If no address is given, this command disassembles from the last
        position or from current PC if no last position is available.
</pre>
<pre>
&gt; disasm pc
$00aa6e : 2f08                                 move.l    a0,-(sp)
$00aa70 : 0241 0fff                            andi.w    #$fff,d1
$00aa74 : 207c 00fe 78c0                       movea.l   #$fe78c0,a0
$00aa7a : 2070 1000                            movea.l   (a0,d1.w),a0
$00aa7e : 4ed0                                 jmp       (a0)
</pre>

<p>
Both commands accept in addition to numeric addresses also register
and symbol names, like in above example.  If you don't specify an
address, the commands continue showing from an address that comes
after the previously shown data.  "disasm" command default address
will be reseted to PC address everytime you re-enter the debugger.
</p>

<p>
You can use the "info" command to see state of specific sets of HW
registers (e.g. "info videl") and Atari OS structures (e.g. "info gemdos").
</p>


<h4>Selecting what information is shown on entering the debugger</h4>

<p>
By using the "lock" command, you can ask Hatari to show specific
information whenever you enter the debugger / hit a breakpoint. For
example to see disassembly from current PC address, use "lock disasm".
</p>

<p>
With the "regaddr" subcommand, you see disassembly or memory
dump of an address pointed by a given register ("lock regaddr disasm
a0"). Of the DSP registers, only Rx ones are valid for this
subcommand.
</p>

<p>
"file" subcommand can be used to get (arbitrary number of) commands
parsed and executed from a given debugger input file whenever debugger
is entered.  With this you can output any information you need:
</p>
<pre>
lock file debugger.ini
</pre>

<p>
To disable showing of this extra information, use "lock default".
Without arguments "lock" command will show the available options
(like the "info" command does).
</p>


<a name="Debug symbols"></a><h3>Debug symbols</h3>

<p>
You can load symbol name/address information from a file to the
debugger with the "symbols" command (and with "dspsymbols" for DSP).
These symbolic names can be used in arithmetic expressions and
conditional breakpoint expressions.  They also show up in the "disasm"
command output.
</p>

<p>The symbols file format is following:</p>
<pre>
e01034 T random
e01076 T kbdvbase
e0107e T supexec
</pre>
<p>
Where 'T' means text (code), 'D' means data and 'B' means BSS section
type of address.  The hexadecimal address, address type letter and the
symbol name are separated by white space.  Empty lines and lines
starting with '#' (comments) are ignored.
</p>

<p>
AHCC C-compiler can provide a symbol file suitable for this with its
"-n" 'nm' list option (not enabled by default). If you're reverse
engineering some code, you could just create your own symbols file to
help in debugging it later.
</p>

<p>
If you're debugging normal TOS/GEM programs instead of code loaded
into a fixed address (like e.g. EmuTOS is), after the program has been
loaded, load the symbols with the program text segment address offset:
</p>
<pre>
symbols calc.sym "TEXT"
</pre>
<p>
(The value of the above virtual "TEXT" debugger variable comes from a
program basepage, it's set after the program is loaded by TOS, see
"info basepage" output.)
</p>


<a name="Breakpoints"></a><h3>Breakpoints</h3>

<p>
There are two ways to specify breakpoints for Hatari. First, there are
the simple address breakpoints which trigger when the CPU (or DSP)
program counter hits a given address. Use "a" (or "da" for the DSP)
to create them, for example:
</p>
<pre>
a $e01034
a some_symbol
</pre>

<p>
Note that address breakpoints are just wrappers for conditional
breakpoints so you need to use "b" command to remove or list them.
</p>

<p>
Then there are the conditional breakpoints which can handle much more
complex break condition expressions; they can track changes to
register and memory values with bitmasks, include multiple conditions
for triggering a breakpoint and so on.  Use "b" (or "db" for the DSP) 
to manage them.
</p>

<p>Help explains the general syntax:</p>
<pre>
&gt; help b
'breakpoint' or 'b' - set/remove/list conditional CPU breakpoints
Usage:  b &lt;condition&gt; [&amp;&amp; &lt;condition&gt; ...] [:&lt;option&gt;] | &lt;index&gt; | help | all

Set breakpoint with given &lt;conditions&gt;, remove breakpoint with
given &lt;index&gt;, remove all breakpoints with 'all' or output
breakpoint condition syntax with 'help'.  Without arguments,
lists currently active breakpoints.
</pre>

<p>
Unless you give breakpoint one of the pre-defined subcommands ('all',
'help'), index for a breakpoint to remove or no arguments (to list
breakpoints), the arguments are interpreted as a new breakpoint
definition.
</p>

<p>
Each conditional breakpoint can have (currently up to 4) conditions
which are separated by "&amp;&amp;".  All of the breakpoint's
conditions need to be true for a breakpoint to trigger.
</p>


<a name="Breakpoint options"></a><h4>Breakpoint options</h4>

<p>
Normally when a breakpoint is triggered, emulation is stopped and you
get to the debugger. Breakpoint options can be used to affect what
happens when a breakpoint is triggered.  These options are given after
the conditions and are prefixed with ':'. 
</p>

<dl>
<dt><em>&lt;count&gt;</em></dt>
<dd>Break only on every &lt;count&gt; hit. For example, to stop
on every other time PC is at given address, use:
<pre>
a $1234 :2
</pre>
</dd>

<dt><em>once</em></dt>
<dd>
Delete the breakpoint when it's hit i.e. trigger it only once. It may
be useful if you just want to get a specific address. Or if you're on
an instruction that jumps back to a start of the loop and you want to
finish the loop, you couuld use:
<pre>
b pc &gt; "pc" :once
continue
</pre>
</dd>

<dt><em>trace</em></dt>
<dd>
Continue emulation without stopping after printing the value that
triggered the breakpoint and doing other possible option actions.
This is most useful when investigating memory or register value
changes (explained below).
</dd>

<dt><em>lock</em></dt>
<dd>
Show the same information on breakpoint hit as you see when entering
the debugger (see the "lock" command in
<a href="#Inspecting emulation state">Inspecting emulation state</a>
above).  This enables also trace option as you would anyway see this
information if debugger would be entered.
</dd>

<dt><em>file &lt;file&gt;</em></dt>
<dd>
Execute debugger commands from given &lt;file&gt; when this breakpoint
is hit.  With this you have complete control over what information is
show when the debugger is hit, you can even chain breakpoints (as
explained in
<a href="#Chaining breakpoints">Chaining breakpoints</a> later on)
etc.  Use this if "lock" option isn't enough or you want different
information show on breakpoints and when entering the debugger.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Note: you can give multiple options for conditional breakpoints, but
for address breakpoints you can give only one these options.  And
"file" option is supported only for conditional breakpoints.
</p>


<a name="Breakpoint conditions"></a><h4>Breakpoint conditions</h4>

<p>
"b help" explains very briefly the breakpoint condition syntax:
</p>
<pre>
&gt; b help
condition = &lt;value&gt;[.mode] [&amp; &lt;mask&gt;] &lt;comparison&gt; &lt;value&gt;[.mode]

where:
        value = [(] &lt;register/symbol/variable name | number&gt; [)]
        number/mask = [#|$|%]&lt;digits&gt;
        comparison = '&lt;' | '&gt;' | '=' | '!'
        addressing mode (width) = 'b' | 'w' | 'l'
        addressing mode (space) = 'p' | 'x' | 'y'
</pre>

<p>
For CPU breakpoints, mode is the address width; it can be byte ("b"),
word ("w") or long ("l", default).  For DSP breakpoints, mode specifies
the address space: "P", "X" or "Y". Note that on DSP only R0-R7
registers can be used for memory addressing.  For example;
<pre>
db (r0).x = 1 &amp;&amp; (r0).y = 2
</pre>

<p>
If the value is in parenthesis like in '($ff820)' or '(a0)', then the
used value will be read from the memory address pointed by it.  Note
that this conditional breakpoint expression value is checked at
run-time whereas quoted arithmetic expressions (mentioned in
<a href="#Entering arguments to debugger commands">Entering arguments
to debugger commands</a> above) are evaluated already when
adding a breakpoint.  For example, to break when a value in an address
(later) pointed by A0 matches the value <em>currently</em> in D0, one
would use:
</p>
<pre>
b (a0) = "d0"
</pre>

<p>
If you're interested only on certain bits in the value, you can use
'&amp;' and a numeric mask on either side of comparison operator to
mask the coresponding value, like this:
<pre>
b ($ff820).w &amp; 3 = (a0)  &amp;&amp;  (a1) = d0 & %1100
</pre>

<p>
Comparison operators should be familiar from math and C except for '!'
which indicates inequality ("is not") comparison.  For example:
</p>
<pre>
b d0 &gt; $20  &amp;&amp;  d0 &lt; $40  &amp;&amp;  d0 ! $30
</pre>

<p>
As a convenience, if the both sides of the comparison are exactly the
same (i.e. condition is redundant as it's always either true or
false), the <em>right side</em> of the comparison is replaced with
its current value.  This way you can give something like this:
</p>
<pre>
b pc &gt; "pc"
</pre>
<p>As:</p>
<pre>
b pc &gt; pc
</pre>

<p>
That in itself isn't so useful, but for inequality ('!') comparison,
conditional breakpoint will additionally track and output all further
changes for the given address/register expression. This can be used
for example to find out all value changes in a given memory address,
like this:
</p>
<pre>
b ($ffff9202).w ! ($ffff9202).w :trace
</pre>
<p>
Typically with this one would use the breakpoint "trace" option like
above.
</p>


<h4>Breakpoint helper variables</h4>

<p>
In addition to loaded symbols, the debugger supports also setting
conditional breakpoints on values of some "virtual" variables listed
by "b help". For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want the emulation to stop on the first instruction of
    next program, after TOS desktop is up, set a breakpoint on
    the TEXT segment address given in a program basepage:
<pre>
b  pc = TEXT  :once
</pre>
Note: you cannot use an address breakpoint for this because value of a
variable given to it is evaluated when the breakpoint is set, not at
run-time, so it cannot get the new value that the TEXT variable gets
when you start a program.
</li>
<li>To find out current program DATA and BSS segment contents,
    use the corresponding variables:
<pre>
m data
m bss
</pre>
</li>
<li>If you want to stop at a specific cycle within a frame (that is,
    PC relative to the current VBL/HBL in cycles), set breakpoints to
    specific "HBL" and "LineCycles" variable values.  If you for
    example want to break after 20 HBLs, use:
<pre>
b  HBL = "HBL+20"
</pre>
</li>
<li>Aes/Bios/Gemdos/LineA/LineF/Vdi/XbiosOpcode variables can be used
    to catch AES, BIOS, GEMDOS, Line-A, Line-F, VDI and XBIOS OS-calls.
    By default they contain the 0xffff value, so to trace e.g. AES calls,
    one needs to use something like this:
<pre>
b  AesOpcode ! AesOpcode  &&  AesOpcode &lt 0xffff  :trace
</pre>
</li>
<!--
<li>"OSExitPC" variable can be used to catch exit from an OS call.
<pre>
b pc = OSExitPC :once
</pre>
It's valid after OS call breakpoint is triggered and before
that call has finished.</li>
-->
</ul>

<p>
Hint: "info" command "aes", "gemdos" and "vdi" subcommands for can be
used to list the corresponding OS-call opcodes. For example,
to see the GEMDOS opcodes, use:</p>
<pre>
info gemdos 1
</pre>


<a name="Chaining breakpoints"></a><h4>
<h4>Chaining breakpoints and other actions</h4>

<p>
As the file pointed by the breakpoint ":file" option (see
<a href="#Breakpoint options">Breakpoint options</a>) can contain any
debugger commands, it can also be used to do automatic "chaining" of
debugger and breakpoint actions so that after one breakpoint is hit,
another one is set.
</p>

<p>For example if you have these input files:</p>
<ul>
<li>"break.ini":
<pre>
b GemdosOpcode = 0x3D :trace :file trace.ini
</pre>
</li>
<li>"trace.ini":
<pre>
setopt --bios-intercept --trace gemdos,xbios,fdc,io_all
b VBL = "VBL+4" :trace :file disable.ini
</pre>
</li>
<li>"disable.ini":
<pre>
trace none
b all
</pre>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
And then start Hatari with the first debugger input file and a GEMDOS
harddisk directory containing "desktop.inf" file:
</p>
<pre>
hatari --parse break.ini -d testdir
</pre>

<ol>
<li>"break.ini" input file will break when TOS opens
    the "desktop.inf" file (it's the first Fopen() i.e. GEMDOS call
    0x3D done by TOS at boot) and the breakpoint will run
    the debugger commands from the "trace.ini" file
<li>"trace.ini" input file sets Hatari to trace several things
    (see <a href="#Tracing">Tracing</a> section below) in the
    emulated system for few VBLs until breakpoint runs commands
    from the "disable.ini" file
<li>"disable.ini" input file will disable tracing and remove
    all (remaining) breakpoints
</ol>

<p>
<em>Note:</em> because debugger input files cannot "continue"
emulation, ":trace" option needs to be used for the breakpoint(s)
if you want emulation to continue after the breakpoint action(s).
</p>

<p>
Hint: It's better to test each input file separate before testing the
whole chain.  Besides the ":file" breakpoint option, these debugger
input files can be also read with the debugger "file" command, "lock"
command "file" option and with the Hatari "--parse" command line
option.
</p>


<a name="Tracing"></a><h3>Tracing</h3>

<p>
After analyzing the emulation state and/or setting new breakpoints,
you can continue the emulation with the "c" command. You can continue
for a given number of CPU instructions (or DSP instructions when "dc"
is used), or you can continue forever (until a non-tracing breakpoint
triggers) if you omit the instruction count.
</p>

<p>
If you want to continue with real-time disassembling, you can enable
it with "trace cpu_disasm" (or "trace dsp_disasm" for DSP) at the
debugger prompt before continuing.
</p>
<p>
Disable tracing with "trace none" when you enter the debugger again.
"trace help" (or TAB) can be used to list all the (over 30) supported
traceable things, from HW events to OS functions.
</p>
<p>
Because Hatari normally emulates things at the hardware level, tracing
certain Atari OS Traps requires setting additional Hatari options
which tell it to intercept this higher level functionality:
<ul>
<li>BIOS and XBIOS tracing require enabling of the BIOS intercepting with
    the "--bios-intercept" option (which has also some other side-effects)
</li>
<li>GEMDOS tracing requires enabling the GEMDOS harddisk emulation
    (which doesn't work under MiNT because it re-implements GEMDOS)</li>
</ul>
<p>
If use of above isn't possible for the things you'd like to track,
you can use the OS call opcode breakpoints explained above with the
":trace" breakpoint option.
</p>
<p>
Tracing options can be set even from a program within the emulation
if you enable the Hatari "--bios-intercept" option and call XBios 255
from the program with a suitable Hatari command line string.  Bios
interception will also show the (Bios level) CON: output on the host
console.
</p>
<p>
Note that the trace output file can be set only when Hatari starts,
it cannot be changed from within the debugger (or emulation).
</p>


<a name="Profiling"></a><h3>Profiling</h3>

<p>
Profiling tells where the emulated code spends most of its (emulated)
time.  It can be used to find out where a program is (apparently)
stuck or what are the largest performance bottlenecks for a program.
</p>

<p>
Profiling is used by first enabling the profiler (use "dp" for DSP):
</p>
<pre>
&gt; profile on
Profiling enabled.
</pre>
<p>
And profiling will start once you continue the emulation:
</p>
<pre>
&gt; c
Returning to emulation...
Allocated CPU profile buffer (18 MB).
</pre>

<p>
When you get back to the debugger, the collected profiling information
is processed and a summary of in which parts of the RAM the execution
happened is shown:
</p>
<pre>
Allocated CPU profile address buffer (4 KB).
Normal RAM (0-0x400000):
- no activity
Cartridge ROM (0xFA0000-0xFC0000):
- no activity
ROM TOS (0xE00000-0xE80000):
- active address range:
  0xe0014c-0xe23f02
- active instruction addresses:
  707 (100.00% of all)
- executed instructions:
  629144 (100.00% of all)
- used cycles:
  9408503 (100.00% of all)
- address with most cycles:
  0xe0dcca, 402628 cycles (4.28% of all in area)
- address with most hits:
  0xe004a4, 4900 hits (0.78% of all in area)
</pre>
<p>
(DSP RAM will be shown only as single area in profile information.)
</p>

<p>
After this you can request more detailed profiling information:
</p>
<pre>
&gt; profile
'profile' - profile CPU code
Usage:  profile &lt;on|off|counts|cycles|symbols|stats&gt; [show count]
	on &amp; off enable and disable profiling.  Data is collected
	until debugger is entered again after which you can view
	statistics about the data or view PC addresses that took
	most cycles or functions/symbols called most often.
	You can specify how many items are shown at most.
</pre>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
&gt; profile counts 8
addr:           count:
0xe004a4        0.78%   4900
0xe004b6        0.78%   4896
0xe0dcbc        0.55%   3448
0xe0dcc6        0.55%   3448
0xe0f59e        0.55%   3446
0xe0dcce        0.55%   3445
0xe0dcd6        0.55%   3445
8 CPU addresses listed.
</pre>
<p>
If you have loaded symbol information for code addresses, with the
"profile symbols" command you get a list of how many times the code
execution passed through the defined symbol addresses.
</p>

<p>
After the profiling information has been post-processed, it will
also be shown in the disassembly output.
</p>


<a name="Build notes"></a><h3>Build notes</h3>

<p>
Lastly, the debugger is much nicer to use with the command line
history, editing and especially with the command, command argument and
symbol name completion support. If you're building Hatari yourself,
please make sure that you have the GNU readline development files
installed (on Debian / Ubuntu these come from the libreadline5-dev
package). Otherwise completion doesn't get enabled when you configure
Hatari.
</p>

<p>
ENABLE_TRACING define needs to be set for tracing to work.
By default it should be enabled.
</p>


<a name="Performance"></a><h2>Performance</h2>

<p>Hatari performance varies between Atari programs, depending on what
features Hatari needs to emulate for them.  Less accurate Atari
emulators may be faster as emulation accuracy has a performance
overhead.</p>

<p>The operating system and libraries below Hatari can also sometimes
have a noticeable effect on performance.</p>


<a name="Improving Hatari performance"></a><h3>Improving Hatari performance</h3>

<p>
Hatari currently runs best in 16 or 32 bits per pixel color depth
mode, so try to avoid 24 bits per pixel display modes if possible.
16-bit mode is fastest.
</p>

<p>
<em>On OSX, frame skipping, zooming and drive LED options (listed below)
seem to have a large effect on performance in the windowed mode</em>.
This is apparently due to issues in the SDL OSX backend and how OSX
itself composites non-fullscreen window contents. OSX uses always
32-bit mode.
</p>

<p>
Unless you've disabled compiler optimizations (like GCC's -O2 or -O3
options) in the Hatari build, the extra optimization flags (like GCC's
"-mtune=i686") don't seem to have very large effect on Hatari
performance.  Using GCC -O3 option instead of -O2 can give minor
(5-10%) performance improvements for things (demos) that use very
heavily interrupts.
</p>

<p>
However, Hatari can be sped up considerably by giving up some
emulation or emulator accuracy.  Except for DSP, these options
should be needed only on very slow devices like handhelds. See below.
</p>

<p>
If nothing else helps, try an earlier Hatari version.  More accurate
emulation or emulator output in newer Hatari versions means that they
can be slower despite optimizations.
</p>


<a name="Emulation options"></a><h3>Emulation options</h3>

<p>
Emulation options have the largest impact on performance.
These options can be changed from the Hatari GUI System dialog and
the emulation needs to be rebooted for any of these changes to take
an effect!
</p>

<h5>DSP</h5>
<p>
Emulating the Falcon DSP is performance-wise several times more demanding
than emulating the m68k; DSP runs at higher frequency, executes many
instructions for each m68k instruction and emulation isn't as mature
and optimized.  Unless some program needs DSP, <em>none</em> or
<em>dummy</em> DSP emulation mode could be used.  Even of the programs
that do use DSP, many use it only for background music and work
fine without the real DSP emulation.
</p>

<h5>Timer-D</h5>
<p>
The single largest factor contributing to general Hatari emulation
performance is the handling of interrupts.  Enabling Timer-D patching
option (about) doubles Hatari ST/STE emulation performance as it
significantly reduces the number of interrupts generated by the emulated
Atari machine. Using this has adverse effect only for very rare programs.
</p>

<h5>Compatible CPU</h5>
<p>
After the DSP and  interrupts, m68k emulation takes most time.
Disabling the "Slower but more compatible CPU" option will speed up
the emulation a lot, but it won't anymore be cycle accurate.  This can
be fine for many games and other programs, but won't work e.g. for demos
using overscan or rasters.
</p>

<p>
Roughly speaking, for DSP emulation, one needs at least 2Ghz machine.
For normal (unpatched) Timer-D frequency on some specific cases (like
demos with overscan 512 color animations) one may need over 1GHz
machine, but some rare ST/STE demos may require over 1GHz machine even
with Timer-D patching.  For "Compatible CPU" one needs at least 1/2Ghz
machine.
</p>

<p>
NOTE: Above options may cause some programs not to work correctly.
The <a href="compatibility.html">Hatari Software Compatibility List</a>
lists programs known to need real real Falcon DSP emulation or Timer-D
frequency.  Disabling "Compatible CPU" option is recommended only as
a last resort.
</p>


<a name="Emulator options"></a><h3>Emulator options</h3>

<p>
Emulator options don't usually have as large effect on performance as
emulation options, but they don't affect the emulated programs at all,
just the quality of the emulation "output". These options can also
be toggled at run-time without rebooting the emulation.
</p>

<h5>Sound</h5>
<p>
Internal Hatari sound handling and the SDL_mixer sound thread
libALSA sound processing can account up to 1/3 of the Hatari CPU usage
in normal ST/STE emulation. Disabling sound will get rid of that.
Using low sound frequency or one matching your sound card may also help.
Best is if you disable also background music from the programs you run
in Hatari as this can significantly reduce the number of generated
interrupts.
</p>

<h5>Frame skipping</h5>
<p>
Screen rendering can take noticeable amount of CPU time. The default
Hatari "auto" frame skipping should be used unless there's a good
reason not to.  It will skip converting and showing some of the frames
if there's not enough time for them.
</p>
<p>
Also, if your monitor refresh frequency is lower than the selected
Hatari monitor frequency (e.g. LCD monitors usually use 60Hz whereas
Atari monochrome monitor uses 71Hz), you should use frameskip of one.
The reason is that if your SDL library uses VSync to synchronize the
output to screen (like OSX one?), with zero frame skip that forces the
emulation to run slower than a real Atari.  If SDL doesn't use VSync,
Hatari does redundant work to convert frames you can't see.
</p>

<h5>Zooming</h5>
<p>
If you are not using frame skip, disabling zooming can have
noticeable improvement on performance.  You can do this by specifying
suitably low "Max zoomed" resolution (<span class="commandline">--zoom
1</span> command line option sets it to 320x200).  If you still want to
have a nice fullscreen mode, you should rather add the right resolution
mode-lines (e.g. "320x200") to your xorg.conf file.  If you still want
to use zooming, disabling borders may help a bit.
</p>

<h5>Spec512 color handling</h5>
<p>
Handling Spec512 color modes which change the ST/e palette constantly
takes some extra CPU.  If you have problems with CPU usage in such
screens and you care more e.g. from the sound quality than visuals, you
can disable the Spec512 mode handling by zeroing the threshold for that
with the <span class="commandline">--spec512 0</span> option.
</p>

<h5>Statusbar and drive LED</h5>
<p>
If your version of libSDL uses VSync to synchronize the screen output,
drawing of the statusbar or the drive LED may have some minor impact
on performance too.  Normally they shouldn't.
</p>


<a name="Measuring the performance"></a><h3>Measuring the performance</h3>

<p>
There are a couple of ways to monitor and measure Hatari performance.
</p>
<p>
By default Hatari has Statusbar visible and automatic frameskip
enabled. When Hatari has enough time that it can sleep a little each
frame, the statusbar frame skip ("FS") value keeps at zero.  If Hatari
is completely busy, it will increase to the maximum specified
(automatic) frame skip value.
</p>
<p>
Hatari has also a facility to measure FPS i.e. Frames Per Second.
Just enable the <span class="commandline">--fast-forward</span> option
on command line (or use the corresponding keyboard shortcut), and
after a while, press the "Pause" key.  Whenever Hatari emulation is
paused, Hatari will output on console how many VBLs it could show per
second along with some other numbers.
</p>
<p>
It depends on what you want to measure, but usually it's best to
disable sound and set high frame skip like
<span class="commandline">--sound off --frameskips 60</span> so that
the associated external overheads are minimized.  E.g. video output
can on some platforms do VSync and measurements would then show
your monitor refresh frequency instead of actual Hatari performance.
</p>
<p>
On Unix systems with <span class="commandline">times()</span> function
call, only the time spent by the Hatari process itself is measured.
On other systems much less accurate SDL "wall clock" timings are
used.  To make latter more accurate you could use also
<span class="commandline">--run-vbls</span> option to specify how many
VBLs Hatari should run before it exits.  In this case it's best to
either have the test-case run automatically from the AUTO-folder or
given as memory snapshot to Hatari with the frame skip set equal to
the VBL count.
</p>
<p>
Note that the numbers can fluctuate quite a bit, <em>especially</em>
when the SDL timings are used, so for (statistically) reliable numbers
you may need to repeat the measurement several times.  You should of
course make also sure that the system doesn't have any other activity
at the same time you're making the measurements.

<a name="Introduction to Emulation"></a><h3>Introduction to Emulation</h3>

<p>Emulation via software is an art and Hatari is an example of this.</p>
<p>Emulation is to make a computer behave like a (probably) completely
different machine on the lowest possible niveau.
This includes CPU and custom chip emulation allowing software written
for the emulated machine to be run without notice.
A good emulator will run most of the software intended for the emulated
platform without trouble.
</p>
<p>
The key to emulation is to simply do those things with a software
program, the emulator, that normally chips would perform.
So you have an CPU emulator that basically consists of a large loop
that does exactly what the real thing would do:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>fetch an instruction from virtual memory</li>
  <li>interpret this instruction</li>
  <li>fetch operands from the emulated registers and memory</li>
  <li>perform the operation like addition or changing the program
counter on a jump instruction</li>
  <li>writes results back into the intended registers or memory
locations</li>
  <li>increment of the program counter and loop</li>
</ul>
<p>
The typical von-Neumann CPU can be emulated very fast, stable and
error-free using such a simple loop system.
</p>
<p>
But in most cases the CPU emulation is the simplest part. Correct
emulation of the various custom chips and hardware
parts of the emulated system is much trickier.
