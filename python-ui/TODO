TODO
====

This lists potential TODO items that aren't listed in the Hatari/UI
sources.

* Supporting new sound frequencies
  (needs Hatari cmd line options update first)

* Supporting setting CPU level & clock and Falcon DSP type

* Supporting ASCI / IDE hard disk image and whether to use these
  or GEMDOS HD dir

* Hatari UI specific configuration which stores:
  - disk image dir (uses Hatari config value as default)
  - trace settings
    - remove dialog specific load/save stuff
  - list of memory snapshots (10?)
  - screenshot name
    - needs support also to Hatari src/screenSnapShot.c

* Features for Help menu:
  - README/TODO/Changelog viewer
  - Create empty floppy images
  - MSA converter

* Work on the debug UI:
  - multiple views to memory
  - trace & debug log viewers

* Put all configuration stuff into single notebook dialog?

* Translation support for the UI

* Supporting other configurable things in Hatari:
  - toggling disk-b autoinsertion, write protection and slow FDC
  - separate A/B disk paths for images within ZIP archives
  - joystick autofire toggling, defining the keys for joyemu
  - keyboard repeat, key mapping type and file
  - multiple GEMDOS partition directories
  - toggling blitter, RTC support, timer-D patching
  - vdi planes and size, SDL bpp forcing, spec512 threshold, frames-per-sec
  - border sizes in windowed and fullscreen mode
  - screen recording type (every frame vs. when changed)
  - cartridge image (where? it has many limitations)
  - log file and levels, bios intercept
  (several of these aren't supported by the internal Hatari UI either)
