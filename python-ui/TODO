TODO
====

This lists potential TODO items that aren't listed in the Hatari/UI
sources.

* Support for enabling printer, serial, midi
  ("hatari-enable/disable/toggle <device>")  

* Support to Hatari UI ("Paths...") for specifying file names
  ("hatari-path <item> <path>") for:
  - memstate auto save file
  - memstate save file
  - sound output
    - needs to check that file name ends either in .ym or .wav
  - printer output
  - midi output
  - rs232 in/out

  Note that reset requiring settings like TOS image,
  harddisk dir & image are different matter

* Support for RTC in machine dialog and remove support for multiple
  setups now that config loading works (there can be different configs
  for ST games & apps, STE demos, TT apps, Falcon demos and apps etc)

* Add autofire support to joystick settings,
  other disk image options to disk settings

* Hatari UI specific configuration which stores:
  - disk image dir (uses Hatari config value as default)
  - trace settings
    - remove dialog specific load/save stuff
  - list of memory snapshots (10?)
  - screenshot name
    - needs support also in screenSnapShot.c

* Features for Help menu:
  - README/TODO/Changelog viewer
  - Create empty floppy images
  - MSA converter

* Work on the debug UI (multiple views to memory)

* Put all configuration stuff into single notebook dialog?

* Translation support for the UI
