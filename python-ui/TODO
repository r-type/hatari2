TODO
====

This lists potential TODO items that aren't listed in the Hatari/UI
sources.

* Separate "Atari monitor" and "Hatari window" settings dialogs
  (move options from "Display" and monitor setting from "Machine"
  dialogs to here and add VDI options to Atari Monitor dialog)

* Features for Help menu:
  - Create empty floppy images (+ convert directories to hard disks?)
  - MSA converter

* Add more Hatari debugger features to the debug UI:
  - DSP support
  - DSP and CPU symbols loading
  - Support for stepping the emulation
  - multiple views to memory (refreshed whenever emulation is stopped)
    - supporting also register relative views (register values
      parsing should move to common functionality first)
  - breakpoint support (issue: how to stop emulation on breakpoint
    but still allow Hatari to process remote commands?)
  - trace & debug log viewers?

* Put all configuration stuff into single notebook dialog?

* Translation support for the UI:
  - use gettext
  - build needs to build & install message catalogs
  - some way for Hatari to forward dialog ID to the remote UI
    with dialog string parameters (filenames etc) which then
    need to be localized too & shown...

* Hatari UI specific configuration which stores:
  - disk image dir (uses Hatari config value as default)
  - trace settings
    - remove dialog specific load/save stuff
  - list of memory snapshots (10?)
  - screenshot name
    - needs support also to Hatari src/screenSnapShot.c

* Supporting other, less important Hatari configuration options:
  - GEMDOS drive write protection, HD booting
  - something for multiple GEMDOS partition directories
  - floppy write protection, toggling disk-b autoinsertion
  - separate A/B disk paths for images that are within ZIP archives
  - joystick autofire toggling, defining the keys for joyemu
  - keyboard repeat, key mapping type and file, mouse grabbing
  - toggling ST blitter, RTC support
  - vdi planes and size, SDL bpp forcing, spec512 threshold, frames-per-sec
  - screen recording type (every frame vs. when changed)
  - cartridge image (where? it has many limitations)
  - log file and levels, bios intercept, run-VBLs
(Many of these aren't supported by the internal Hatari UI either, or
are missing corresponding command line options so they will require
additional support on the Hatari control.c side too.)
