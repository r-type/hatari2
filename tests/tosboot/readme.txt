Usage
-----

If you want to test Hatari version that isn't in your PATH,
you need to give PATH for the Hatari binary you want to test,
like this:
	PATH=../../build/src:$PATH ./tos_tester.py <TOS images>

To view the produced screenshots, either use ImageMagick:
	display output/*.png

Or use the script that creates a HTML page with them and opens
browser to view it.


What TOS tester tests
---------------------

These are the HW configurations combinations that TOS tester currently
supports:

* ST, STE, TT, Falcon machine types

  EmuTOS 512k is tested for all the machine types, EmuTOS 192/256k and
  TOS v2.x with all except Falcon, rest of TOSes are tested only with
  a single machine type.

* TV, VGA, RGB and monochrome monitors and 1 & 4 plane VDI modes

* Different amounts of memory

* With and without GEMDOS harddisk directory emulation

* Arbitrary boolean Hatari command line options

You can use the command line options to specify which set of these
is used and TOS tester will go through all combinations of them.


What to test
------------

For each Hatari release it would be good to test e.g. the following
TOS versions:
  v1.00 de, v1.02 de, v1.04 de, v1.04 us, v1.62 de, v1.62 us,
  v2.06 de, v3.06 us, v4.04, etos192k, etos512k[1]

[1] Just the latest release of EmuTOS.

And following monitor configurations:
  ST:     tv,  mono, vdi-1, vdi-4
  STE:    rgb, mono, vdi-1, vdi-4
  TT:     vga, mono, vdi-1, vdi-4
  Falcon: rgb, mono, vga

Memory configurations:
  ST:   0.5 &  2 MB
  STE:    1 &  4 MB
  TT:     2 & 10 MB
  Falcon: 4 & 14 MB

And both with GEMDOS HD and just floppy.

Testing should be done both for old UAE CPU core and the new WinUAE
one.  This should give good enough coverage of all the possible bootup
issues.


TODO
----

Do more testing and add some usage examples.

Atari testing app should also copy file contents (with redirection)
and TOS tester script should check that copied file contents match
original.

More GEMDOS tests to testing app?

--

Add testing of ASCI and IDE drives in addition to the GEMDOS HD and
floppy tests.

This isn't very straightforward because both needed different drivers
and images and some have issues with different TOS versions and
formatting requires using interactive Atari programs, so they cannot
be automatically re-generated.

EmuTOS supports directly HDs with DOS (not Atari) partition table,
but only for ASCI.  Maybe that could be tested first, possibly with
a disk having also MiNT (= WinUAE / MMU testing at the same time).
