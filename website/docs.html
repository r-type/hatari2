<h2>Frequently asked questions:</h2>

<h3 class="question">Q: I can't compile Hatari!?</h3>
<p>
A: You should check if you have installed all needed tools for compiling Hatari:
The GNU C compiler (GCC), GNU make (sometimes also called &quot;gmake&quot;,
other versions of make might not work), development files for the SDL library
and the ZLib compression library.  Also, if you want screenshots in PNG
format, you'll need development files for libpng.
</p>

<h3 class="question">Q: Why is Hatari so slow? Are there any possibilities
  to speed it up?</h3>
<p>
A: Have a look at the
<a href="http://hg.berlios.de/repos/hatari/raw-file/tip/doc/manual.html#Performance">Performance
section</a> of the manual.
</p>

<h3 class="question">Q: Game XY does not work, what can I do?</h3>
<p>
A: There can be many reasons why a game does not work immediately. Changing one of the
following configuration settings often helps:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
 Many ST games often need a certain TOS version to run right. Old games
 often only work with TOS 1.00 or TOS 1.02, so you should try these TOS versions
 first. If the game still does not work, you should also try TOS 1.04 and 2.06.
 Some games also either need a NTSC (US American) or a PAL (European) TOS,
 so it might be useful to test these different types, too.
</li>
<li>
 There are also some games which do not work in STE mode - but there
 are also some few games which only work in STE mode and not in ST mode.
 So changing the machine type might be worth a try, too.
</li>
<li>
 Some games also need certain RAM sizes, for example some games do not work
 with 4 MB memory size!
</li>
<li>
 And finally, try to enable the &quot;Slower but more compatible CPU&quot; and/or
 disable the &quot;Patch Timer-D&quot; in the system options dialog. This slightly
 increases compatibility with the real ST. In some few cases you also have to enable
 the &quot;Slow floppy access&quot; option in the floppy options dialog to mimic
 the speed of the original floppy disk drive.
</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="question">Q: How can I use MIDI on Mac OS X or Windows?</h3>
<p>
 A: MIDI currently only works on Linux (and maybe some *BSD systems) where Hatari
 can write the MIDI output to a device file in the /dev file system.
 On all other systems, MIDI is not supported.
</p>

<h3 class="question">Q: Why is the 68k CPU speed limited to so few MHz?</h3>
<p>
 A: The development goal of Hatari is to provide a good emulator for running
 old games and demos, so we focus on a cycle accurate emulator.
 If you rather want to run GEM applications as fast as possible, you should
 better use another emulator that better suits this goal.
